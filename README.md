# Statistical Analysis Report on AI Global Index
This project presents a statistical and probabilistic analysis of the AI Global Index. It focuses on exploring the trends, distributions, and correlations within the data using concepts of probability and statistics.
Key highlights of the project include:

Data Collection: Sourcing and organizing data from the AI Global Index.

Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation), probability distributions, and inferential statistics.

Visualizations: Graphs and charts (e.g., histograms, boxplots, scatterplots) to illustrate key insights.

Interpretations: Drawing conclusions from the statistical findings in the context of global AI development.

This project was created as part of a Probability course project to practically apply statistical methods to real-world AI data.
